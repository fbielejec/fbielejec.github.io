### About me

I am FIlip Bielejec, a freelance software developer.
I studied Applied Mathematics before working as a developer in various roles and industries, from authoring OpenSource software for geo-awareness in epidemiology, co-developing high-performance library for highly-parallel processors, navigation and map-data solutions to healthcare and insurance.

These days I focus on systems written in Clojure / Clojurescript.
