If you're a geek like I am, you must remember that [scene in The Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PxTAn4g20U) when Trinity fires up [nmap](https://nmap.org/) on 10.2.2.2 and finds a vulnerability in SSH to exploit.

Its [author](https://github.com/fyodor) was apparently dancing in the aisles of the cinema when he saw his creation in the movie. Well, [Spread](https://spreadviz.org/) sorta-kinda had its first moment of fame too!

# <a name="congratulations"/> Congratulations to Professor Philippe Lemey!

First and foremost, I want to start this post by extending my congratulations to my former PhD supervisor, [Professor Philippe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/evolutionary-and-computational-virology-publications/00036765), who has received the prestigious [Francqui-Collen Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francqui_Prize) in Brussels on June 6th, 2023, from the hands of the King of the Belgians, Filip.
The prize, aptly referred to as the "Belgian Nobel Prize," was awarded to Philippe for his pioneering work against the spread of viruses.

Professor Lemey is not only a great researcher but also a fantastic person and a real role model. It's always great to see when such individuals receive the recognition they deserve.
So once again, a huge congratulations to him!

# <a name="vrtnws"/> Spread on the national news

On this occasion, VRT, the national public broadcaster for the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, has aired a segment about Professor Lemey and the work of him and his lab.

It was really cool to see the material include a clear shot of Spread in use ðŸ˜„.
The entire segment can be found [here](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2023/06/06/francqui-collen-prijzen/), and at 58 seconds into the second video, there is a close-up of the tool being used.
