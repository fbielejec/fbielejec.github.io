In a previous entry I wrote a [progress update](https://www.blog.nodrama.io/spread-progress-update/) on the [Spread](https://spreadviz.org/) web application for the analysis & vizualization of virus evolution and dispersal.
I have detailed the major achieved milestones and what remains to be done before the software can be released to the wide audience.

Today I am happy to announce that the software is ready to use and availiable at [spreadviz.org](https://spreadviz.org).
Moreover it will soon be published in a peer-reviewed journal [VirusEvolution](https://academic.oup.com/ve).
